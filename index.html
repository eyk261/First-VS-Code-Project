            Lalibela (Amharic: ላሊበላ) is a town in the Amhara Region of Ethiopia. Located in 
            the Lasta district and North Wollo Zone, it is a tourist site for its famous rock-cut monolithic churches. The whole of Lalibela is a large and important site for the antiquity, medieval, 
            and post-medieval civilization of Ethiopia.<br>
            The Rock-hewn Churches of Lalibela are monolithic churches located in the Western Ethiopian Highlands near the town of Lalibela,
             named after the late-12th and early-13th century King Gebre Mesqel Lalibela of the Zagwe Dynasty, 
            who commissioned the massive building project of 11 rock-hewn churches to recreate the holy city of Jerusalem in his own kingdom.
